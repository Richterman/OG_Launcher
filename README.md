Just a small custom linux launcher i wrote for Open Goal using bash.

The depencies are kdialog, dialog, and zenity

Please make sure to install zenity, dialog, and kdialog; along with all related open goal dependencies for a developer environment; before running the script.

I was having problems creating an automated install of the script into .local/
Please run my OG_Launcher install script before running.
